/*

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

This is pretty standard, I am still learning the code. I don't know how I would do
a palindrome as a string yet. I'm not sure why I used long's here, I think I may
have been trying very large ints.
